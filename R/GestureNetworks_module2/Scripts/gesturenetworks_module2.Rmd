## Background

Here we will generalize the gesture network approach for motion data with multiple persons who are interacting. So please inspect module 1 first (1. Pouw & Trujillo, 2021) before proceeding with this module. We will also work with data that requires much more pre-processing as to show the complexities involved of more real-world data that was not originally collected for current purposes.

## The dataset
The dataset used here is from the original "Envision" team design dataset where a group of 3 team-members is designing a hypothetical product. Based on the range of annotations that were available for this ~30 min design session, we have cut those events from the videos that were re-edited as first-person perspective videos for each of the teammembers. So have various sorts of coded events, some of which are relevant for kinematics, such as information about gestures and actions such as writing and touching objects, and some that were generated but are not so relevant for us (e.g., talking about the usability of the object). Each of these subvideos were tracked using mediapipe hand tracking where we set it to track 2 hands max. The videos are stored in the subfolder "./DataEnvision/MTvideos/" and the concomitant time series are in the subfolder "./DataEnvision/MTvideos/Timeseries/".

## Setting up
Per usual, lets start with initializing our folders and some basic packages.

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#packages
library(dtw)         #for dynamic time warping
library(rjson)       #for extracting json info
library(stringr)     #for manipulations of strings
library(ggplot2)     #plotting
library(plotly)     #plotting

#set current as working drive via session -> set working drive -> source file location
workingdrive <- getwd() 
basefolder   <- dirname(workingdrive)
timeserfolder <- paste0(basefolder, "/DataEnvision/Timeseries/") #the original timeseries
timeseriespfol <- paste0(basefolder, "/DataEnvision/TimeseriesAmenable/") #the time series that we eventually will analyze
animationsfol <-  paste0(basefolder, "/DataEnvision/AnimationsMT/") #the animations that we will create
timesers <- list.files(timeserfolder)
distancematfolder <- paste0(basefolder, "/DataEnvision/DistanceMatrices/") #the DTW distance mattrix
anno <- read.csv(paste0(basefolder, "/DataEnvision/Annotation_info/group_10_recoding.csv")) #original annotation information
```

# Preprocessing

There are several issues that we need to consider for this data:

* The hand motion tracking is not working as nicely for these videos, so we have a lot of missing frames or hands that are confused by machine labels (e.g., two left hands tracked), sometimes making it difficult to link the hands from frame to frame. 
** To solve this we will only analyze gesture events of which 50% of the time we have some signal for both left and right hand, and the rest we interpolate using a linear interpolation. This is only for demonstration purposes; we do not advice using data with 50% loss and we have a mediapipe linking script in the envision toolbox that optimizes the linking of hand from frame to frame for mediapipe ouput.

* We do not have codings about which hand is performing the action type (or whether both hands are performing it)
** To solve this we will identify which hand was moving the most during the coded event and then select that as our dominant hand

* We want to treat left handed actions to be comparable to right handed actions
** To solve this we will mirror the left hand trajectory about the vertical axis, so that it can be directly compared to right handed gestures too

* The hand trajectories might start of at different points due to different initial posture conditions
** We will center the motion traces by the over all mean 

Lets proceed and implement these major steps. In the next procedure we will go through all events, and select only those that are relevant for manual kinematics, and we perform the preprocessing steps. We are then left with timeseries that are "amenable to analysis", and we will store these in the subfolder "/DataEnvision/AmenableTimeseries/".

```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(zoo)   #linear approximation
library(readr) #string manipulation
library(kza)   #smoothing of timeseries

#loop through each annotation
  #which annotation types are not related to manual behavior, lets ignore these
whichtypes <- c("feature", "scaffolds", "Use Case Scenario", "Usability", "Function")

#we are applying the preprocessing on left and right hands
  #so lets make a function for it, so we reduce code repeatability
  #arguments: data = motion tracking position data
            # timef = time variable with no missing frames included (for interpolation)
            # check which hand we are applying this procedure for
preprocess.it <- function(data, timef, hand)
{
  #merge the original data with timef
  mmt <- merge(timef, data, by.x="timef", by.y = "time", all = TRUE) 
  #interpolate NA's
  mmt[,6:ncol(mmt)] <- apply(mmt[,6:ncol(mmt)], 2, FUN = function(y){na.approx(y, x= mmt$timef, na.rm = FALSE)})
  #remove trailing NA's and only keep interpolated values
  mmt <- na.trim(mmt[which(mmt$interpol=="interpolated"),6:ncol(mmt)]) 
  #Centering/mirroring and rescaling
    #center horizontal position traces
    indexx <- which(substr(colnames(mmt),1,1)%in% c("X")) #check which column contain x data
    if(hand == "left") #mirror hand for left hand
    {
    mmt[,indexx] <- mmt[,indexx]*-1    #flip x axis if hand is left hand
    }
    mmt[,indexx] <- mmt[,indexx]-mean(colMeans(mmt[,indexx]))     #center by the overall mean    
    #center, and flip y axis (to make sure hand is back in first person perspective)
    indexy <- which(substr(colnames(mmt),1,1)%in% c("Y")) #check which column contain y data
    mmt[,indexy] <- mmt[,indexy]-mean(colMeans(mmt[,indexy]))     #center by the overall mean    
    mmt[,indexy] <- mmt[,indexy]*-1   
    #note that the Z dimension that mediapipe already centered this (by the wrist as reference)
    return(mmt) #return the preprocessed dataframes
}

#main routine preprocessing

    #check how many lost frames
      #count the number of skipped frames and divide this about the 
      #amount of frames needed based on length of the original annotation window
    mtmiss  <- sum(diff(mtleft$index)[which(diff(mtleft$index)>1)]-1)/(lenact/(1000/samplerate))
    if(mtmiss>cutoffmissing) #first pass (is there any data that we have 50% info for)
    {
        mtleftpp  <-   preprocess.it(mtleft, timef, "left") #apply our function
        mtrightpp <-   preprocess.it(mtright, timef, "right") #apply our function
        leftmovtot  <- sum(apply(mtleftpp, 2, FUN=function(x)abs(diff(x)))) #amount of displacement in x,y,z dimension
        rightmovtot <- sum(apply(mtrightpp, 2, FUN=function(x)abs(diff(x)))) #amount of displacement in x,y,z dimension
      #second pass pick hand which is moving most
      MT <- if(leftmovtot > rightmovtot){mtleftpp}else(mtrightpp)
      #apply smoothing filter
      MT <- apply(MT, 2, FUN = function(x)kz(x, 3, 3))
      #save selected data
      write.csv(MT,  paste0(basefolder, "/DataEnvision/TimeseriesAmenable/", anno$id[j], ".csv"))
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Animating trajectories
Sometimes it is helpful and simply crucial to check our data dynamically after all these operations (centering, mirroring, smoothing) and we can animate some datapoints as .gif files. We will therefore plot x an y trajectories for each of the amenable timeseries. The below code takes a long time, as we are rendering all the motion events to .gif files so that we can inspect and call them out if needed. However, we added a statement that this should only be run if there are no .gif files generated yet (you can comment that statement out if you want to run this anyway, or delete the gif files in the folder to generate again).

```{r, eval =FALSE}
library(gganimate) #for animating
library(gifski)    #for animating
library(magick)    #for animating

timeseriess <- list.files(timeseriespfol)

for(ts1 in timeseriess) #loop through i
  {
  ################Uncomment if you want to run
  if(!file.exists(paste0(animationsfol, str_replace(ts1,".csv", ""), "_group10.gif")))
    {
  ###############
  TS1 <- read.csv(paste0(timeseriespfol, ts1))[,-1] #read in the amenable timeseries
  keypointsx <- which(substr(colnames(TS1),1,1)%in% c("X")) #identify x columes
  keypointsy <- which(substr(colnames(TS1),1,1)%in% c("Y")) #identify y columes
  #we have 21 keypoints so lets plot them as points for x an y
  p1 <- ggplot(TS1)+geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[1]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[1]]), size = 5) +
                geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[2]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[2]]), size = 5)+

                geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[12]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[12]]), size = 5)+
                geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[13]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[13]]), size = 5)+
                geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[14]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[14]]), size = 5)+

                geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[16]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[16]]), size = 5)+
                geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[17]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[17]]), size = 5)+
                geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[18]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[18]]), size = 5)+
                geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[19]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[19]]), size = 5)+
                geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[20]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[20]]), size = 5)+
                geom_point(aes(x= TS1[,keypointsx[21]], y=TS1[,keypointsy[21]]), size = 5)+
    theme_void()+ylim(-0.3, 0.3)+xlim(-0.3, 0.3)
                           
  p1 <- p1 + transition_time(1:nrow(TS1)) #animate it by adding transion reveal
  animate(p1, nrow(TS1), fps = 30) #animate the plot
  anim_save(paste0(animationsfol, str_replace(ts1,".csv", ""), "_group10.gif")) #save the animation
  }
}
```

The above generates the preprocessed data. Lets compare the original video with mediapipe tracking, with the actual preprocessed data. Here are two examples. It looks OK for these examples. Some frames are clearly missing as you can see, but for further demonstration purposes we can proceed.

# Constructing a distance matrix 

So we are ready to go for computing some gesture networks. If you are already familiar with gesture networks module 1 (https://wimpouw.github.io/EnvisionBootcamp2021/gesturenetworks_module1.html) you will see clear commonalities. There are some slight changes however. Firstly, we now do a completely *dependent* dynamic time warping versions as we have one hand that we can treat as a single system with each joint position as defining its state space. Further, we perform a DTW version which does not allow for a lot of errors to be accumulated at the beginning and end of the timeseries; this avoids problems of overestimating of kinematic distances because the events begin and end points are not well defined (see 5). We will perform this DTW forwards and backwards because it can have different results depending on which time series you submit as referent and which as query. Finally, we submit to DTW all the time *differientated* motion traces of hand keypoints. So we submit the velocities of each keypoint of the hand to be compared to the velocities of the another hand.   

This operation takes quite a bit to run (about 15/20 minutes for us) as we have a lot of datapoints for the hands (You could speed this operation up by using parallel computing; reducing the number of markers; or performing faster dtw calculation than the current). One day we will do a module on fast gesture network computation using parallel computing. For now we will run this (if the file is not generated yet).

```{r}
library(dtw) #our DTW package by Giorgino et al
timeseriess <- list.files(timeseriespfol)
#lets order from beginning to end (so that we also have some info of time occurence)
 #** not the annotation id's are ordered by time, so that lower ids were events that occured earlier
idorder <- order(as.numeric(substr(timeseriess,1,nchar(timeseriess)-4)))
timeseriess <- timeseriess[idorder] #now order our list of files according to time occurence

#Main DTW implementation
DTW.forwardbackward <- function(TS1, TS2)
{
  #perform the dynamic time warping backwards and forwards, extract the distance, and then average
  distancedtw <-  
    (dtw(TS1, TS2, step.pattern = asymmetric, open.end=TRUE, open.begin=TRUE)$normalizedDistance + #forward
    dtw(TS2, TS1, step.pattern = asymmetric, open.end=TRUE, open.begin=TRUE)$normalizedDistance)/2 #backward
}

#lets only do this operation if we have not generated the matrix yet
  #uncomment if you want to run yourself
if(!file.exists(paste0(distancematfolder, "distance_matrix.csv")))

# Visualizing results
We have a distance matrix filled with the distances of the amenable time series. We can proceed with visualizations. Note, that now we have information about three (!) persons contained in our matrix. Lets first set up a general plotting procedure. Note this time we use a different dimensionality reduction technique (t-sne) as the one used in module 1 (mds).


```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tsne)
distmat <- read.csv(paste0(distancematfolder, "distance_matrix.csv")) #load in our produced matrix

#get info about coding type
  #keep only the annotations that are amenable to analyses
features <- anno[anno$id%in%parse_number(colnames(distmat)),] 
  #we ordered them by id number, so we do the same to get our features that align with our matrix
features <- features[order(features$id),] 
 
#Main plotting function
plot.space <- function(top, title, feature1, sizepoint, timeline)
{
  top <- cbind.data.frame(top, feature1)
  colnames(top) <- c("Xpos", "Ypos", "feature1")
  pl <- ggplot(top, aes(x= Xpos, y = Ypos)) + geom_point(aes(color=feature1),size= sizepoint, alpha= 0.5)+theme(legend.position = "none")
  if(timeline == TRUE) #if we want to connect the nodes by their adjacent occurence in time
    {
    pl<- pl+geom_path(alpha=0.5)
    }
  pl <- pl+  theme_bw() + ggtitle(title) + xlab("Dimension 1") + ylab("Dimension 2")
  return(pl)
}

#perform a dimensionality reduction on the distance matrix 
  #lets use something different: t-distributed stochastic nearest neighbor
set.seed(1) #tsne uses random processes so set seed
topology <- tsne(distmat, perplexity=12) #the topology changes drastically depending on perplexity; 
                                         #the value is parameter that changes the sensitivity 
                                         #to what is considered a nearest neighbor
```

Lets look at the gestures and enactments that were made, and also plot the original coding qualitative labels. The function for this plot is to see how the kinematic space relates to the qualitative labels. You can select and deselect specific labels. For example, it is clear that writing, touching, and sketching, occupy, a small region in the kinematic space, why gestures ("G-..") and enactments are much more varied.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
#plot the tsne 
ggplotly(plot.space(topology, 
                    title= "distances represented through tsne", 
                    feature1= as.factor(features$coding),  
                    sizepoint = 10, 
                    timeline = FALSE))
```

Now, of course we are interested in team dynamics. So we should also visualize how persons were interrelating in the team. Lets only look at enactments and gestures, then color the nodes based on the person (1, 2, or 3). We also want some information about time. So we can connect the nodes so that each node is connected to the node belonging to the event that followed in time. One thing we noticed, is that at some point in time gestures tended to occupy a clustered region; it may just be that the diversity of the kinematic trajectories were decreasing and settling on something, as if common ground was achieved. This is all speculation of course; but something we can asses further in an explorative way. Further, note that one person is especially vigorously moving (bit this might be biased by tracking issues we talked about earlier). In any case, you can imagine that each team will have different kinematic space topologies, and different division of labour and creativity, and these can in principle be operationalized by performing computations on the distance matrix (e.g., clustering). Another option is to transform the distance matrix in a real network representation and then computing classic network topology measures.   

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
enactments <- which(grepl("G-", features$coding, fixed = TRUE)|grepl("Enactment", features$coding, fixed = TRUE)) #lets only look at enactments
featuresenact <- features[enactments,]
topologyenact <- topology[enactments,]
#plot the tsne 
ggplotly(plot.space(topologyenact, 
                    title = "distances represented through tsne", 
                    feature1 = as.factor(featuresenact$person), 
                    sizepoint= 10,
                    timeline= TRUE))
```

# plotting animations
So again we can do some animated networks, similar to module1. Lets plot 25% of the enactments .gifs in a kinematic space that we generated; more would clutter the animation too much.
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(scales)  #for rescaling 

topologyHTML <- apply(topologyenact[,1:2], 2, FUN=function(x)scales::rescale(x, from=range(x), c(0,1000))) #lets rescale the toplogy from 0 to 600 pixels
nams <- parse_number(colnames(distmat[enactments, enactments]))

todraw <- ""
layer = 1
adjustright = 300
adjustvertical = -100
#we are only showing 33% of the videos, otherwise it is very crowded
for(i in 1:(round(length(nams)/4)))
{
todraw <- paste0(todraw, paste0('<img src="AnimationsMT/', nams[i], '_group10.gif" style="position: absolute; top: ', round(topologyHTML[i,1]+adjustvertical),'px; right:',  round(topologyHTML[i,2]+adjustright), 'px; width: 7%; height: auto; zindex:',layer,'; border: solid 1px #CCC"/>'))
layer <- layer+1
}

fileConn<-file("animated_kinematicspace2.html") #save to a seperate html file
writeLines(todraw, fileConn)
close(fileConn)
```

# Applications
  
## Changes over time (convergence)

Does gesture start to converge over time in this team? It seemed to be the case in one of the previous plots of the kinematic distances. Maybe, if we compute the euclidean distance from each event in the kinematic space (i.e., coordinates of the distance matrix) to the next, we will see that over time the traveled distances becomes less. If so, it seems that that the manual behaviors are are more convergent over time. Lets compute this from the distance matrix. From the figure below, it seems that the later an event in the team design session the less divergent a position in the kinematic space was as compared to the previous one.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
submat <- distmat[enactments, enactments] #only keep gesture/enactments events

time <- euclid <- vector() #get the original time that the event occured, and compute euclidean distance of an event (relative to previoyus)
for(i in 2:ncol(submat))
{
  curid <- parse_number(colnames(submat)[i]) #what is the current id of the event
  time   <- c(time, features$begintime[features$id==curid]) #what was the time of this event
  euclid <- c(euclid, sqrt(sum(submat[,i-1]-submat[i])^2)) #euclidean distance between gesture at index i-1 and gesture at index i
}
 
dat <- cbind.data.frame(time, euclid) #save info in dataframe and plot
a <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = time, y = euclid))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm")+theme_bw()+ylab("travel in kinematic space") + xlab("time")+
  ggtitle("kinematic space traveled over time")
ggplotly(a)
```
