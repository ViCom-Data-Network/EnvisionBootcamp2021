    "In this module, we'll demonstrates how to perform motion tracking using the lightweight tool MediaPipe, and considers some of the pros and cons of this method. Specifically, we'll be using MediaPipe for hand-tracking in situations where a) we have multiple people in frame from a top view, b) a single person from top view, and c) a single person for front-view. Single person tracking is a more easily processable as we will explain, as it much easier to identify which hands belong to which person from frame to frame. In the case of multi-person hand tracking we require a little bit more post-processing to identify persons from frame to frame (the envision toolbox also contains a script for linking person from frame to frame in such cases).\n",

    "Here we will cover how to utilize MediaPipe to acquire motion tracking of the hands, from multiple people. MediaPipe offers a nice lightweight (computationally) solution to capture hand motion from multiple people (or just one person). We'll first go over some code to get body and hand tracking. \n",

    "Above we have the first 5 rows of our output data. The first named column, \"index\", provides you with the frame number. Note that each frame may have multiple rows, if multiple hands are tracked in that frame. We also get a label, right or left, and x,y,z coordinates (scaled to 0,1 --- see below) for each keypoint. <br>\n",
    "<h3> Output Details </h3>\n",
    "The 3D coordinate output is certainly an advantage for MediaPipe, as it is able to provide some sense of depth, even if you don't have multiple camera angles or an actual depth image (e.g, as recorded by infrared sensors). The authors of MediaPipe achieve this by training their detector model on a synthetic dataset where they could vary the pose and orientation of the hand in many ways, but always have ground-truth 3D coordinates. As they state in the Zhang et al., 2020 paper:  <i>\"Synthetic dataset: To even better cover the possible hand poses and provide additional supervision for depth, we render a high-quality synthetic hand model over various backgrounds and map it to the corresponding 3D coordinates. We use a commercial 3D hand model that is rigged with 24 bones and includes 36 blendshapes, which control fingers and palm thickness. The model also provides 5 textures with different skin tones. We created video sequences of transformation between hand poses and sampled 100K images from the videos.\" Zhang et al., 2020 </i><br>\n",
    "It is important to note that the depth provided in this output, however, Mediapipe does allow for estimating positions in meters (see https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html to see which function you need to use for this). In the current example case, a point with x,y coordinates = 0.5, 0.5 would be in the center of the image, while x,y = 0.25, 0.75 would indicate that the point is 1/4 of the way from left to right, and 3/4 of the way from top to bottom (x,y = 0,0 is the top left corner). For depth, it is relative to the wrist. In other words, the wrist is taken as the origin (0 depth), and smaller values are estimated to be closer to the camera, and larger values further away. <br>\n",
    "This relative scaling makes it difficult to compare across videos with different camera set-ups, but is quite intuitive when looking at the coordinates compared to the actual video.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>However, especially for multi-party data we don't know if the first row in frame 1 is the same hand as the first row in frame 2. Thus, we don't know if a left and right hand belong together as there are multiple persons! We'll cover a potential solution to this in the module on linking and pairing hands. This is easier when there is just one person, as mediapipe does differientate between left and right hand. "
